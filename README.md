# n8n Nodes - Apify integration

This is an n8n community node that integrates [Apify](https://apify.com) with your n8n workflows, so you can run Apify Actors, extract structured data from websites, and automate complex web scraping tasks.

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a platform for developers to build, deploy, and publish web automation tools, while [n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) tool for AI workflow automation that allows you to connect various services.

## Installation

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: v18.10+)
- pnpm installed globally

---

### 1. Initialize n8n locally

Begin by installing and running n8n to create the necessary configuration directory (`~/.n8n`):

```bash
npm install -g n8n # Skip this step if you already have n8n installed globally
n8n start # This will generate the ~/.n8n directory
```

### 2. Clone and build the Node Package

Install dependencies and build the node:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### 3. Link the custom node to n8n

Create the `custom` directory inside `~/.n8n` (if it doesn't exist), then symlink your local node package:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.n8n/custom
ln -s /full/path/to/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler ~/.n8n/custom/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler # replace full/path/to with the path to your n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler directory
```

> **Note:** Use the absolute path in the symlink for compatibility.

### 4. Restart n8n

Now that your custom node is linked, start n8n again:

```bash
n8n start
```

---

### 🔁 Making changes

If you make any changes to your custom node locally, remember to rebuild and restart:

```bash
pnpm run build
n8n start
```

---

## Self-hosted n8n: Public webhook URL for triggers

This configuration is required for our service's trigger functionality to work correctly.

By default, when running locally n8n generates webhook URLs using `localhost`, which external services cannot reach. To fix this:

1. **Set your webhook URL**  
In the same shell or Docker environment where n8n runs, export the `WEBHOOK_URL` to a publicly-accessible address. For example:
  ```bash
  export WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-tunnel.local"
  ```
2. **Restart n8n** 
  ```bash
  pnpm run build
  n8n start
  ```

## Operations

![triggers](./docs/trigger.png)

## Credentials

The node supports two authentication methods:

1. **API key authentication**
   - Configure your Apify API key in the n8n credentials section under `apifyApi`

2. **OAuth2 authentication** (available only in n8n cloud)
   - Configure OAuth2 credentials in the n8n credentials section under `apifyOAuth2Api`

![auth](./docs/auth.png)

# Releasing a New Version

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the release process, including publishing to npm. Here's how to trigger a new release.

**Prerequisites (for all methods):**

* Ensure your target branch on GitHub is up-to-date with all changes you want to include in the release.
* Decide on the new version number, following semantic versioning (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`).
* Prepare your release notes detailing the changes.
* If you're using CLI to release, make sure you have the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

---

## Method 1: Using the GitHub Web UI (Recommended for ease of use)

1.  **Navigate to GitHub Releases:**
    * Go to your repository’s "Releases" tab

2.  **Draft a New Release:**
    * Click the **“Draft a new release”** button.

3.  **Create or Choose a Tag:**
    * In the “Choose a tag” dropdown:
        * **Type your new tag name** (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
        * If the tag doesn't exist, GitHub will prompt you with an option like **“Create new tag: v1.2.3 on publish.”** Click this.
        * Ensure the **target branch** selected for creating the new tag is correct. This tag will point to the latest commit on this target branch.

4.  **Set Release Title and Notes:**
    * Set the "Release title" (e.g., `vX.Y.Z` or a more descriptive title).
    * For the release notes in the description field, you have a few options:
        * **Write your prepared release notes.**
        * **Click the "Generate release notes" button:** GitHub will attempt to automatically create release notes based on merged pull requests since the last release. You can then review and edit these auto-generated notes.

5.  **Publish the Release:**
    * Click the **“Publish release”** button.

    *Upon publishing, GitHub creates the tag from your specified branch and then creates the release. This "published" release event triggers the automated workflow.*

---

## Method 2: Fully CLI-Driven Release

This method uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all steps, including tag creation.

1.  **Ensure your local target branch is synced and changes are pushed:**
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    ```

2.  **Create the Release (which also creates and pushes the tag):**
    Replace `vX.Y.Z` with your desired tag/version. The command will create this tag from the latest commit of your specified `--target` branch (defaults to repository's default branch, if `--target` is omitted and the branch is up to date).

    ```bash
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes "Your detailed release notes here.
        - Feature X
        - Bugfix Y"

    # Or, to use notes from a file:
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" \
        --notes-file ./RELEASE_NOTES.md

    # Or, to generate notes from pull requests (commits must follow conventional commit format for best results):
    gh release create vX.Y.Z \ 
        --target master \
        --title "vX.Y.Z" 
        --generate-notes
    ```
    
    * `vX.Y.Z`: The tag and release name.
    * `--target <branch>`: Specifies which branch the tag should be created from (e.g., `master`). If the tag `vX.Y.Z` doesn't exist, `gh` will create it based on the HEAD of this target branch and push it.
    * `--title "<title>"`: The title for your release.
    * `--notes "<notes>"` or `--notes-file <filepath>` or `--generate-notes`: Your release notes.

    *This command will create the tag, push it to GitHub, and then publish the release. This "published" release event triggers the automated workflow.*

## Post-Release: Automated Workflow & Verification (Common to all methods)

Regardless of how you create and publish the GitHub Release:

1.  **Automated Workflow Execution:**
    * The "Release & Publish" GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger.
    * It will perform:
        1.  Code checkout.
        2.  Version extraction (`X.Y.Z`) from the release tag.
        3.  Build and test processes.
        4.  Update `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to version `X.Y.Z`.
        5.  Commit these version changes back to the branch the release was targeted from with a message like `chore(release): set version to X.Y.Z [skip ci]`.
        6.  Publish the package `@apify/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler@X.Y.Z` to npm.

2.  **Verify the Package on npm:**
    After the workflow successfully completes (check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository):
    * Verify the new version on npm:
        ```bash
        pnpm view @apify/n8n-nodes-apify-content-crawler version
        ```
        This should print `X.Y.Z`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

1. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct

2. **Resource Not Found**
   - Verify the resource ID format
   - Check if the resource exists in your Apify account
   - Ensure you have access to the resource

3. **Operation failures**
   - Check the input parameters
   - Verify resource limits (memory, timeout)
   - Review Apify Console for detailed error messages
