Go from beginner to expert, all in one place.\nWelcome to Web scraping basics for JavaScript devs, a comprehensive, practical and long form web scraping course that will take you from an absolute beginner to a successful web scraper developer. If you're looking for a quick start, we recommend trying this tutorial instead.\nThis course is made by Apify, the web scraping and automation platform, but we will use only open-source technologies throughout all academy lessons. This means that the skills you learn will be applicable to any scraping project, and you'll be able to run your scrapers on any computer. No Apify account needed.\nIf you would like to learn about the Apify platform and how it can help you build, run and scale your web scraping and automation projects, see the Apify platform course, where we'll teach you all about Apify serverless infrastructure, proxies, API, scheduling, webhooks and much more.\nWhy learn scraper development?​\nWith so many point-and-click tools and no-code software that can help you extract data from websites, what is the point of learning web scraper development? Contrary to what their marketing departments say, a point-and-click or no-code tool will never be as flexible, as powerful, or as optimized as a custom-built scraper.\nAny software can do only what it was programmed to do. If you build your own scraper, it can do anything you want. And you can always quickly change it to do more, less, or the same, but faster or cheaper. The possibilities are endless once you know how scraping really works.\nScraper development is a fun and challenging way to learn web development, web technologies, and understand the internet. You will reverse-engineer websites and understand how they work internally, what technologies they use and how they communicate with their servers. You will also master your chosen programming language and core programming concepts. When you truly understand web scraping, learning other technologies like React or Next.js will be a piece of cake.\nCourse Summary​\nWhen we set out to create the Academy, we wanted to build a complete guide to web scraping - a course that a beginner could use to create their first scraper, as well as a resource that professionals will continuously use to learn about advanced and niche web scraping techniques and technologies. All lessons include code examples and code-along exercises that you can use to immediately put your scraping skills into action.\nThis is what you'll learn in the Web scraping basics for JavaScript devs course:\nWeb scraping basics for JavaScript devs \nBasics of data extraction\nBasics of crawling\nBest practices\nRequirements​\nYou don't need to be a developer or a software engineer to complete this course, but basic programming knowledge is recommended. Don't be afraid, though. We explain everything in great detail in the course and provide external references that can help you level up your web scraping and web development skills. If you're new to programming, pay very close attention to the instructions and examples. A seemingly insignificant thing like using [] instead of () can make a lot of difference.\nIf you don't already have basic programming knowledge and would like to be well-prepared for this course, we recommend learning about JavaScript basics and CSS Selectors.\nAs you progress to the more advanced courses, the coding will get more challenging, but will still be manageable to a person with an intermediate level of programming skills.\nIdeally, you should have at least a moderate understanding of the following concepts:\nJavaScript + Node.js​\nIt is recommended to understand at least the fundamentals of JavaScript and be proficient with Node.js prior to starting this course. If you are not yet comfortable with asynchronous programming (with promises and async...await), loops (and the different types of loops in JavaScript), modularity, or working with external packages, we would recommend studying the following resources before coming back and continuing this section:\nasync...await (YouTube)\nJavaScript loops (MDN)\nModularity in Node.js\nGeneral web development​\nThroughout the next lessons, we will sometimes use certain technologies and terms related to the web without explaining them. This is because their knowledge will be assumed (unless we're showing something out of the ordinary).\nHTML\nHTTP protocol\nDevTools\njQuery or Cheerio​\nWe'll be using the Cheerio package a lot to parse data from HTML. This package provides an API using jQuery syntax to help traverse downloaded HTML within Node.js.\nNext up​\nThe course begins with a small bit of theory and moves into some realistic and practical examples of extracting data from the most popular websites on the internet using your browser console. Let's get to it!\nIf you already have experience with HTML, CSS, and browser DevTools, feel free to skip to the Basics of crawling section.",

With this SERP Scraper API, you will be able to **extract the following Google data from each Google page**:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td> 🌱 Organic results </td>\n<td> 🛍 Paid results </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🤖 AI Overviews </td>\n<td> 📢 Product ads </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> ❓ Related queries </td>\n<td> 🙋‍♀️ People Also Ask </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🏷 Prices </td>\n<td> ⭐️ Review rating and review count  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🪴 Suggested results </td>\n<td> 🔍 Additional custom attributes  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## 💯 How many results can you scrape with Google Search Scraper?\n\nGoogle Search Scraper can return **up to 300 results for one keyword**. This is due to the limitations of Google itself: although it shows as if it has millions of results for a given search query, Google will always display a maximum of three pages. With a maximum 100 results shown per page, this makes up to 300 results in total.\n\nIf your use case doesn\'t require otherwise, we strongly recommend you to keep the setting or  **`Results per Google page`** to the max 100, so that you get 100 results per 1 page instead of crawling 10 pages, each with 10 results. The 10 by 10 is also possible but since you’re paying for request, it will be ten times more pricey than it could’ve been).\n\nWhile we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\n## 💸 How much will scraping Google Search cost you?\n\nGoogle Search Scraper uses the Pay-per-result pricing model, so your costs can be easily calculated: it will cost you $3.50 to scrape 1,000 search results, so $0.0035 per item. With Apify’s [Free plan](https://apify.com/pricing), you get $5 in usage credits every month, allowing you to **scrape over 1,400 results from Google for free**.\n\nIf you need to scrape data regularly, we recommend getting an Apify subscription. The [$49/month Starter plan](https://apify.com/pricing) can get you **over 14,000 Google results each month**.\n\n## ⬇️ Google Search data input\n\nThe scraper gives you really good control over what kind of Google Search results you\'ll get. You can specify the following settings:\n\n- Query phrases or raw Google search URLs 🔍\n- Country/search domain 🗺\n- Language of search 🇬🇧\n- Exact geolocation 📍\n- Number of results per page 🔟\n- Mobile or desktop version results 📱\n\nFor a complete description of all settings, see the [Input tab](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper/input-schema).\n\n### How to scrape Google Search results by URL or keyword\n\nThere are two ways you can scrape Google search pages: either by URL or by search term.\n\n1. Scraping **by URL** will get you data from Google Search results page. You\'ll get Google data from a copy-pasted Google URL with any Google country domain (e.g. `google.co.uk`). You can add as many URLs as you want.\n2. Scraping **by search term** will also get you data from Google Search results page. You can also add as many search terms as you want.\n\n#### Example input for scraping Google Search search term\n\nIt is also easy to get Google search data by search term. Just enter the search term and a number of Google pages to scrape. With this option, you also can:\n\n- scrape by multiple keywords in parallel by adding more search terms and separating them by a new line\n- indicate how many results you want to see per each Google page (10-100)\n- indicate the country of search (domain), language, and UULE location parameter\n\n<a href="https://console.apify.com/actors/nFJndFXA5zjCTuudP/input">\n    <img width="75%" src="https://i.imgur.com/mIYv0eZ.png" />\n</a>\n\nHere\'s its equivalent in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  "countryCode": "us",\n  "customDataFunction": "async ({ input, $, request, response, html }) => {\\\\\\\\n  return {\\\\\\\\n    pageTitle: $(\'title\').text(),\\\\\\\\n  };\\\\\\\\n};",\n  "includeUnfilteredResults": false,\n  "languageCode": "en",\n  "maxPagesPerQuery": 2,\n  "mobileResults": false,\n  "queries": "hotels in Seattle \\\\n hotels in New York",\n  "resultsPerPage": 10,\n  "saveHtml": false,\n  "saveHtmlToKeyValueStore": false,\n  "maxConcurrency": 10\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Scrape Google Search results by URL\n\nTo input URLs instead, simply replace `queries` with full URLs:\n\n```json\n"queries": "<https://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+in+Seattle> \\\\n <https://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+in+New+York>",\n\n```\n\n## ⬆️ Google Search data output\n\nThe scraper stores its result in the default [dataset](https://apify.com/docs/storage#dataset) associated with the scraper run, from which you can export it to various formats, such as JSON, XML, CSV, or Excel.\n\n### Output example (by search term)\n\nFor each Google Search results page, the dataset will contain a single record, which looks as follows. Note that the output preview will be organized in table and tabs for viewing convenience:\n\n[![Google SERP API Scraper](https://github.com/natashalekh/natashalekh.github.io/blob/main/Google%20SERP%20API%20Scraper.gif?raw=true)](https://console.apify.com/actors/nFJndFXA5zjCTuudP/input)\n\n\nAnd here’s the equivalent of the same scraped data but in JSON. Bear in mind that some fields have example values: <br>\n\n```json\n{\n    "searchQuery": {\n        "term": "hotels in seattle",\n        "url": "<http://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=hotels%20in%20seattle>",\n        "device": "DESKTOP",\n        "page": 1,\n        "type": "SEARCH",\n        "domain": "google.com",\n        "countryCode": "US",\n        "languageCode": null,\n        "locationUule": null,\n        "resultsPerPage": "100"\n    },\n    "url": "<http://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=hotels%20in%20seattle>",\n    "hasNextPage": true,\n    "serpProviderCode": "N",\n    "resultsTotal": 54000000,\n    "relatedQueries": [\n        {\n            "title": "Feedback",\n            "url": "<https://www.google.com/#>"\n        },\n        {\n            "title": "Hyatt Regency Seattle",\n            "url": "<https://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=Hyatt+Regency+Seattle&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOOQUeLSz9U3MDHOSTEwNRJNzsnMTSxJVSjISU1JT1XIyC9JzSmOEoTQCpl5CsWpiSUlOamnGJG0QTlGVWbpBkVQTm5ZXnFG8ilGHv10fcPKXAujksKUNKhceVp6RVI5lGOcYZicnnSKkRuksCSl2CwlJ_cXo6gz1CEByA5pYGFcxCrqUQl0gkJQanpqXnKlQjDEQbfYJBlKnl2b9VUhNGan8tzMrdvyU0SSttVPXDDVAAAvau1f5QAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRxJ_e2J__AhUVZTABHRosAFcQs9oBKAB6BAgXEAI>"\n        }\n        // ... and many more\n    ],\n    "paidResults": [\n        {\n            "title": "Hotels in Seattle, WA - Lowest Price Guarantee.",\n            "url": "<https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMzqXe2J__AhW_gVoFHbh6BGYYABABGgJ2dQ&sig=AOD64_3PbWI_s3u1fE0Dh4Dobi56jDDCfw&q&adurl>",\n            "displayedUrl": "",\n            "description": "",\n            "emphasizedKeywords": [],\n            "siteLinks": [\n                {\n                    "title": "",\n                    "url": "<https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMzqXe2J__AhW_gVoFHbh6BGYYABAHGgJ2dQ&sig=AOD64_3x8pu1mywduFwZgi9cwut7L9Nrvg&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiRxJ_e2J__AhUVZTABHRosAFcQh78CegQIDhAB&adurl=>",\n                    "description": ""\n                },\n                {\n                    "title": "Hotels at Great Prices",\n                    "url": "<https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMzqXe2J__AhW_gVoFHbh6BGYYABADGgJ2dQ&sig=AOD64_1Bl0Ju75dgDPwLJAb53UYrV1xyMQ&q&adurl>",\n                    "description": ""\n                }\n                // ... and many more\n            ],\n            "type": "paid",\n            "adPosition": 1\n        },\n        {\n            "title": "Cheap Hotels in Seattle - Best Deals in Seattle",\n            "url": "<https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMzqXe2J__AhW_gVoFHbh6BGYYABAAGgJ2dQ&sig=AOD64_27qRewPYeehK82DHa3ck7RlyilRg&q&adurl>",\n            "displayedUrl": "",\n            "description": "",\n            "emphasizedKeywords": [],\n            "siteLinks": [\n                {\n                    "title": "",\n                    "url": "<https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMzqXe2J__AhW_gVoFHbh6BGYYABACGgJ2dQ&sig=AOD64_0sufwpcy9IZTR-ZX82HaFX1Xqc-w&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiRxJ_e2J__AhUVZTABHRosAFcQh78CegQIBxAB&adurl=>",\n                    "description": ""\n                }\n            ],\n            "type": "paid",\n            "adPosition": 2\n        }\n    ],\n    "paidProducts": [],\n    "organicResults": [\n        {\n            "title": "The Best Hotels in Seattle, WA",\n            "url": "<https://www.hotels.com/de1481165/hotels-seattle-washington/>",\n            "displayedUrl": "<https://www.hotels.com> › ... › Hotels in Washington",\n            "description": "The Inn at Virginia Mason · The Belltown Inn · Hyatt Regency Seattle · Mediterranean Inn · Hotel Max · Crowne Plaza Seattle - Downtown, an IHG Hotel · Mayflower Park ...",\n            "emphasizedKeywords": [\n                "Seattle",\n                "Hotel",\n                "Seattle",\n                "Hotel"\n            ],\n            "siteLinks": [],\n            "productInfo": {},\n            "type": "organic",\n            "position": 1\n        },\n        {\n            "title": "THE 10 BEST Hotels in Seattle, WA 2023 (from $87)",\n            "url": "<https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60878-Seattle_Washington-Hotels.html>",\n            "displayedUrl": "<https://www.tripadvisor.com> › ... › Seattle Hotels",\n            "description": "Popular hotels in Seattle right now · 1.

A list of other [Google-related scrapers.](https://apify.com/store?search=google)\n\n### Want to scrape images from Google?\n\nIf you\'re looking to scrape specific [data from public Google services](https://apify.com/store/categories?search=google), you\'re in luck! Whether it\'s for extracting location details, reviews, trends, or even job listings, there’s a dedicated scraper for each case. Browse through these tailored solutions to find the one that fits your needs:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>📍 <a href="https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor">Google Maps Extractor</a></td>\n<td>👁 <a href="https://apify.com/alexey/google-lens">Google Lens Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🎓 <a href="https://apify.com/marco.gullo/google-scholar-scraper">Google Scholar Scraper</a></td>\n<td>🛍 <a href="https://apify.com/emastra/google-shopping-scraper">Google Shopping Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>📈 <a href="https://apify.com/emastra/google-trends-scraper">Google Trends Scraper</a></td>\n<td>⭐️ <a href="https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-reviews-scraper">Google Reviews Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🖼 <a href="https://apify.com/hooli/google-images-scraper">Google Images Scraper</a></td>\n<td>🗞 <a href="https://apify.com/lhotanova/google-news-scraper">Google News Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🧾 <a href="https://apify.com/silva95gustavo/google-ads-scraper">Google News Scraper</a></td>\n<td>📇 <a href="https://apify.com/epctex/google-jobs-scraper">Google Jobs Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n#### How do I scrape millions of results from Google?\n\nPlease note that, although Google always shows that it has found millions of results, **Google will never display more than a few hundred results for a single search query** 🤥 If your goal is to get as many results as possible, try creating many similar queries and combine different parameters and locations.\n\n#### How do I scrape Google ads?\n\nDespite the fact that scraping Google is the best shot we\'ve got at seeing objective Google results, **displayed paid results are still heavily dependent on your location and browsing history**. It’s also up to Google to choose which ads to show to which user (hello, cookies 🍪). It might be underwhelming to see less results than you\'d expected. Most probably, Google\'s precise algorithm is the reason for it.\n\n#### Is it legal to scrape Google search results?\n\nWeb scraping is legal if you are extracting publicly available data, but you should respect boundaries such as personal data and intellectual property regulations.\nRule of thumb is: you should only scrape personal data if you have a legitimate reason to do so, factoring in Google\'s [Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en) as well. If you\'re unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. We also recommend that you read our blog post on the subject: [is web scraping legal?](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/)\n\n\n#### How can I use data scraped from Google Search?\n\nGoogle SERP API has a lot to offer in terms of how extracted Google data can be applied:\n\n🔸 **Use it for search engine optimization (SEO)** and monitor how your website performs on Google for certain queries over time.\n\n🔹 **Monitor how frequently a search term has been used** on Google, and how it compares with total search volume.\n\n🔸 **Analyze display ads** for a given set of keywords.\n\n🔹 **Monitor your competition** in both organic and paid results.\n\n🔸 **Build a URL list for certain keywords**. This is useful if, for example, you need good relevant starting points when scraping web pages containing specific phrases.\n\n🔹 **Analyze Google algorithm** and identify its main trends\n\n#### Can I integrate Google Scraper with other apps?\n\nLast but not least, this Google SERP API can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to [integrations on the Apify platform](https://apify.com/integrations). You can integrate with Make, Zapier, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive, [and more](https://docs.apify.com/integrations). Or you can use [webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/integrations/webhooks) to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g. get a notification whenever Google Search Results Scraper successfully finishes a run.\n\n#### Can I use Google Scraper with the API?\n\nThe Apify API gives you programmatic access to the Apify platform. The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints that enable you to manage, schedule, and run Apify Actors. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more.\n\nTo access the API using Node.js, use the `apify-client` NPM package. To access the API using Python, use the `apify-client` PyPi package.\n\nCheck out the [Apify API reference docs](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) for full details or click on the [API tab](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper/api/javascript) for code examples. You can also follow [this video guide](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViYYDHSBAKM).\n\n#### How to get one search result per row\n\nSimply choose the Export view for `Organic results` and/or `Paid results`, it automatically spreads each result into a separate row. For API access, you can add `&view=paid_results` or `&view=organic_results` to the URL and with the API client, you can do the same using the `view` field.\n\nAn organic result is represented using the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  "searchQuery": {\n    "term": "laptop",\n    "device": "DESKTOP",\n    "page": 1,\n    "type": "SEARCH",\n    "domain": "google.com",\n    "countryCode": "US",\n    "languageCode": "en",\n    "locationUule": null,\n    "resultsPerPage": 10\n  },\n  "type": "organic",\n  "position": 1,\n  "title": "Laptops & Notebook Computers - Best Buy",\n  "url": "<https://www.bestbuy.com/site/computers-pcs/laptop-computers/abcat0502000.c?id=abcat0502000>",\n  "displayedUrl": "<https://www.bestbuy.com> › Computers & Tablets",\n  "description": "Shop Best Buy for laptops. Work & play from anywhere with a notebook computer. We can help you find the best laptop for your specific needs in store and online.",\n  "emphasizedKeywords": "laptops | laptop",\n  "productInfo": {}\n}\n\n```\n\nA paid result has an `adPosition` field instead of `position` and `"type": "paid"`. **Paid result position is calculated separately from the organic results**.\n\nWhen using a tabular format such as `csv` or `xls`, you\'ll get a table where each row contains just one organic result. For more details about exporting and formatting the dataset records, please see the documentation for the [Get dataset items](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.\n\n#### Not your cup of tea? Build your own scraper.\n\nThis Google SERP API doesn’t exactly do what you need? You can always build your own! We have various [scraper templates](https://apify.com/templates) in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript to get you started. Alternatively, you can write it from scratch using our [open-source library Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/). You can keep the scraper to yourself or make it public by adding it to Apify Store (and [find users](https://apify.com/partners/actor-developers) for it).\n\n\n#### Your feedback\n\nIf you are not sure that the results are complete and of good quality, each run stores the full HTML page to the default Key-Value Store. You can view the KVS by clicking on it and comparing the results. \n\nWe’re always working on improving the performance of our Actors and monitoring the quality but we are happy for any reports.

				"### 2024-08-22 (0.0.128)\n\n*Fixes*\n- Renable exluding results based on `:site` filter parameter as there were several reports when Google didn't respect this filter.\n\n### 2024-06-14 (0.0.122)\n\n*Fixes*\n- Disable excluding results based on `:site` filter parameter. The actor was checking whether all results from Google match the `site:` filter and excluded those that didn't match. This feature was buggy so we decided to disable it.\n\n### 2024-06-03 (0.0.121)\n\n*Fixes*\n- Don't distinguish `http` vs `https` when filtering results with the `:site` clause.\n\n*Features*\n- Add `includeIcons` to input to extract result icons in base64 format. The image data is relatively large so we decided not to include it by default.\n\n### 2024-04-23 (0.0.119)\n\n*Fixes*\n- Fixed extracting `personalInfo` from linkedin sites\n\n### 2024-04-08 (0.0.118)\n\n*Fixes*\n- Fixed `personalInfo` extraction in mobile results\n- Fixed `relatedQueries` extraction in mobile results\n- Store the results suggested by Google to `suggestedResults` instead of `organicResults`\n\n### 2024-02-12 (0.0.113)\n\n*Improvements*:\n- Actor continues scraping the next page if number of organic and paid results is greater than 80% of `resultsPerPage`.\n\n### 2023-12-23 (0.0.109)\n*Fixes*\n- Improve handling of potentially non-matching `site:` filters. We check for a correct format and track any inconsistencies if there would be any. Users often use the filter in wrong format (e.g. `-site:` or multiple `site:` which doesn't work)\n\n### 2023-12-23 (0.0.108)\n*Fixes*\n- Fix problem that sometimes not all `relatedQueries` were extracted\n\n### 2023-10-30 (0.0.106)\n*Fixes*:\n- Fixed extraction of `companyName` field\n\n### 2023-09-25 (0.0.103)\n*Fixes*:\n- Updated css selector for result's description\n\n### 2023-08-21 (0.0.100)\n\n*Fixes*:\n- Fixed issue with pagination, where some pages Google returned didn't have the next page (depending on IP used).

For API access, add `&view=paid_results` or `&view=organic_results` to the URL.\n- Added `type`: `organic` or `paid` and `position` or `adPosition` to all organic and paid results for consistency.\n\n*Changes*\n- Deprecated input field `csvFriendlyOutput`, please migrate to using the new output schema formats. We will keep supporting `csvFriendlyOutput` for some time.\n\n### 2023-05-29 (0.0.81)\n*Fixes*\n- Replaces `\\t` characters in queries with spaces. Previously, they were briefly ignored which broke some queries.\n\n### 2023-04-06\n*Fixes*\n- Fixed personal info for LinkedIn results\n\n### 2023-03-7\n\n*Changes*\n- Updated to version 3\n\n*Fixes*\n- Updated ads URLs selectors for desktop and mobile\n\n### 2023-02-15\n\n*Fixes*\n- Updated `relatedQueries` selectors to work with the new layout\n\n### 2023-01-20\n\n*Fixes*\n- Log proper error is `customDataFunction` throws an error\n- Log an error if a request fails all retries\n\n*Changes*\n- If `customDataFunction` throws an error, normal output is still returned, instead of crashing\n\n### 2023-01-19\n\n*Fixes* (new layout)\n- Fixed organic desktop results\n- Fixed organic mobile missing title and displayUrl\n- Fixed organic mobile missing top results\n- Deduplicate results\n\n### 2022-11-17\n\n- Fixed mobile extractor, paidResults, siteLinks, and description\n\n### 2022-11-16\n\n- Fixed mobile extractor paidResults, paidProducts, organicResults\n\n### 2022-08-24\n\n- Fixed organic results sometimes missing top result and twitter based results\n\n### 2022-05-03\n\n- Added `personalInfo` to output containing `name`, `location`, `jobTitle`, `companyName`, `cleanDescription`.

					'## 🔎 What is a Google scraper?\n\nOur free SERP scraper crawls Google Search Results Pages (SERPs) and extracts data from those web pages in structured formats such as JSON, XML, CSV, or Excel. To extract images, visit our [Google Images Scraper](https://apify.com/hooli/google-images-scraper). With this SERP Scraper API, you will be able to **extract the following Google data from each Google page**:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td> 🌱 Organic results </td>\n<td> 🛍 Paid results </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🤖 AI Overviews </td>\n<td> 📢 Product ads </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> ❓ Related queries </td>\n<td> 🙋‍♀️ People Also Ask </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🏷 Prices </td>\n<td> ⭐️ Review rating and review count  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 🪴 Suggested results </td>\n<td> 🔍 Additional custom attributes  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## 💯 How many results can you scrape with Google Search Scraper?\n\nGoogle Search Scraper can return **up to 300 results for one keyword**. This is due to the limitations of Google itself: although it shows as if it has millions of results for a given search query, Google will always display a maximum of three pages. With a maximum 100 results shown per page, this makes up to 300 results in total.\n\nIf your use case doesn\'t require otherwise, we strongly recommend you to keep the setting or  **`Results per Google page`** to the max 100, so that you get 100 results per 1 page instead of crawling 10 pages, each with 10 results. The 10 by 10 is also possible but since you’re paying for request, it will be ten times more pricey than it could’ve been).\n\nWhile we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\n## 💸 How much will scraping Google Search cost you?\n\nGoogle Search Scraper uses the Pay-per-result pricing model, so your costs can be easily calculated: it will cost you $3.50 to scrape 1,000 search results, so $0.0035 per item. With Apify’s [Free plan](https://apify.com/pricing), you get $5 in usage credits every month, allowing you to **scrape over 1,400 results from Google for free**.\n\nIf you need to scrape data regularly, we recommend getting an Apify subscription. The [$49/month Starter plan](https://apify.com/pricing) can get you **over 14,000 Google results each month**.\n\n## ⬇️ Google Search data input\n\nThe scraper gives you really good control over what kind of Google Search results you\'ll get. You can specify the following settings:\n\n- Query phrases or raw Google search URLs 🔍\n- Country/search domain 🗺\n- Language of search 🇬🇧\n- Exact geolocation 📍\n- Number of results per page 🔟\n- Mobile or desktop version results 📱\n\nFor a complete description of all settings, see the [Input tab](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper/input-schema).\n\n### How to scrape Google Search results by URL or keyword\n\nThere are two ways you can scrape Google search pages: either by URL or by search term.\n\n1. Scraping **by URL** will get you data from Google Search results page. You\'ll get Google data from a copy-pasted Google URL with any Google country domain (e.g. `google.co.uk`). You can add as many URLs as you want.\n2. Scraping **by search term** will also get you data from Google Search results page. You can also add as many search terms as you want.\n\n#### Example input for scraping Google Search search term\n\nIt is also easy to get Google search data by search term. Just enter the search term and a number of Google pages to scrape. With this option, you also can:\n\n- scrape by multiple keywords in parallel by adding more search terms and separating them by a new line\n- indicate how many results you want to see per each Google page (10-100)\n- indicate the country of search (domain), language, and UULE location parameter\n\n<a href="https://console.apify.com/actors/nFJndFXA5zjCTuudP/input">\n    <img width="75%" src="https://i.imgur.com/mIYv0eZ.png" />\n</a>\n\nHere\'s its equivalent in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  "countryCode": "us",\n  "customDataFunction": "async ({ input, $, request, response, html }) => {\\\\\\\\n  return {\\\\\\\\n    pageTitle: $(\'title\').text(),\\\\\\\\n  };\\\\\\\\n};",\n  "includeUnfilteredResults": false,\n  "languageCode": "en",\n  "maxPagesPerQuery": 2,\n  "mobileResults": false,\n  "queries": "hotels in Seattle \\\\n hotels in New York",\n  "resultsPerPage": 10,\n  "saveHtml": false,\n  "saveHtmlToKeyValueStore": false,\n  "maxConcurrency": 10\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Scrape Google Search results by URL\n\nTo input URLs instead, simply replace `queries` with full URLs:\n\n```json\n"queries": "<https://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+in+Seattle> \\\\n <https://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+in+New+York>",\n\n```\n\n## ⬆️ Google Search data output\n\nThe scraper stores its result in the default [dataset](https://apify.com/docs/storage#dataset) associated with the scraper run, from which you can export it to various formats, such as JSON, XML, CSV, or Excel.\n\n### Output example (by search term)\n\nFor each Google Search results page, the dataset will contain a single record, which looks as follows. Note that the output preview will be organized in table and tabs for viewing convenience:\n\n[![Google SERP API Scraper](https://github.com/natashalekh/natashalekh.github.io/blob/main/Google%20SERP%20API%20Scraper.gif?raw=true)](https://console.apify.com/actors/nFJndFXA5zjCTuudP/input)\n\n\nAnd here’s the equivalent of the same scraped data but in JSON.

A list of other [Google-related scrapers.](https://apify.com/store?search=google)\n\n### Want to scrape images from Google?\n\nIf you\'re looking to scrape specific [data from public Google services](https://apify.com/store/categories?search=google), you\'re in luck! Whether it\'s for extracting location details, reviews, trends, or even job listings, there’s a dedicated scraper for each case. Browse through these tailored solutions to find the one that fits your needs:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>📍 <a href="https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor">Google Maps Extractor</a></td>\n<td>👁 <a href="https://apify.com/alexey/google-lens">Google Lens Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🎓 <a href="https://apify.com/marco.gullo/google-scholar-scraper">Google Scholar Scraper</a></td>\n<td>🛍 <a href="https://apify.com/emastra/google-shopping-scraper">Google Shopping Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>📈 <a href="https://apify.com/emastra/google-trends-scraper">Google Trends Scraper</a></td>\n<td>⭐️ <a href="https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-reviews-scraper">Google Reviews Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🖼 <a href="https://apify.com/hooli/google-images-scraper">Google Images Scraper</a></td>\n<td>🗞 <a href="https://apify.com/lhotanova/google-news-scraper">Google News Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>🧾 <a href="https://apify.com/silva95gustavo/google-ads-scraper">Google News Scraper</a></td>\n<td>📇 <a href="https://apify.com/epctex/google-jobs-scraper">Google Jobs Scraper</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n#### How do I scrape millions of results from Google?\n\nPlease note that, although Google always shows that it has found millions of results, **Google will never display more than a few hundred results for a single search query** 🤥 If your goal is to get as many results as possible, try creating many similar queries and combine different parameters and locations.\n\n#### How do I scrape Google ads?\n\nDespite the fact that scraping Google is the best shot we\'ve got at seeing objective Google results, **displayed paid results are still heavily dependent on your location and browsing history**. It’s also up to Google to choose which ads to show to which user (hello, cookies 🍪). It might be underwhelming to see less results than you\'d expected. Most probably, Google\'s precise algorithm is the reason for it.\n\n#### Is it legal to scrape Google search results?\n\nWeb scraping is legal if you are extracting publicly available data, but you should respect boundaries such as personal data and intellectual property regulations.\nRule of thumb is: you should only scrape personal data if you have a legitimate reason to do so, factoring in Google\'s [Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en) as well. If you\'re unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. We also recommend that you read our blog post on the subject: [is web scraping legal?](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/)\n\n\n#### How can I use data scraped from Google Search?\n\nGoogle SERP API has a lot to offer in terms of how extracted Google data can be applied:\n\n🔸 **Use it for search engine optimization (SEO)** and monitor how your website performs on Google for certain queries over time.\n\n🔹 **Monitor how frequently a search term has been used** on Google, and how it compares with total search volume.\n\n🔸 **Analyze display ads** for a given set of keywords.\n\n🔹 **Monitor your competition** in both organic and paid results.\n\n🔸 **Build a URL list for certain keywords**. This is useful if, for example, you need good relevant starting points when scraping web pages containing specific phrases.\n\n🔹 **Analyze Google algorithm** and identify its main trends\n\n#### Can I integrate Google Scraper with other apps?\n\nLast but not least, this Google SERP API can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to [integrations on the Apify platform](https://apify.com/integrations). You can integrate with Make, Zapier, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive, [and more](https://docs.apify.com/integrations). Or you can use [webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/integrations/webhooks) to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g. get a notification whenever Google Search Results Scraper successfully finishes a run.\n\n#### Can I use Google Scraper with the API?\n\nThe Apify API gives you programmatic access to the Apify platform. The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints that enable you to manage, schedule, and run Apify Actors. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more.\n\nTo access the API using Node.js, use the `apify-client` NPM package. To access the API using Python, use the `apify-client` PyPi package.\n\nCheck out the [Apify API reference docs](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) for full details or click on the [API tab](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper/api/javascript) for code examples. You can also follow [this video guide](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViYYDHSBAKM).\n\n#### How to get one search result per row\n\nSimply choose the Export view for `Organic results` and/or `Paid results`, it automatically spreads each result into a separate row. For API access, you can add `&view=paid_results` or `&view=organic_results` to the URL and with the API client, you can do the same using the `view` field.\n\nAn organic result is represented using the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  "searchQuery": {\n    "term": "laptop",\n    "device": "DESKTOP",\n    "page": 1,\n    "type": "SEARCH",\n    "domain": "google.com",\n    "countryCode": "US",\n    "languageCode": "en",\n    "locationUule": null,\n    "resultsPerPage": 10\n  },\n  "type": "organic",\n  "position": 1,\n  "title": "Laptops & Notebook Computers - Best Buy",\n  "url": "<https://www.bestbuy.com/site/computers-pcs/laptop-computers/abcat0502000.c?id=abcat0502000>",\n  "displayedUrl": "<https://www.bestbuy.com> › Computers & Tablets",\n  "description": "Shop Best Buy for laptops. Work & play from anywhere with a notebook computer. We can help you find the best laptop for your specific needs in store and online.",\n  "emphasizedKeywords": "laptops | laptop",\n  "productInfo": {}\n}\n\n```\n\nA paid result has an `adPosition` field instead of `position` and `"type": "paid"`. **Paid result position is calculated separately from the organic results**.\n\nWhen using a tabular format such as `csv` or `xls`, you\'ll get a table where each row contains just one organic result. For more details about exporting and formatting the dataset records, please see the documentation for the [Get dataset items](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.\n\n#### Not your cup of tea? Build your own scraper.\n\nThis Google SERP API doesn’t exactly do what you need? You can always build your own! We have various [scraper templates](https://apify.com/templates) in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript to get you started. Alternatively, you can write it from scratch using our [open-source library Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/). You can keep the scraper to yourself or make it public by adding it to Apify Store (and [find users](https://apify.com/partners/actor-developers) for it).\n\n\n#### Your feedback\n\nIf you are not sure that the results are complete and of good quality, each run stores the full HTML page to the default Key-Value Store. You can view the KVS by clicking on it and comparing the results. \n\nWe’re always working on improving the performance of our Actors and monitoring the quality but we are happy for any reports. So if you’ve got any technical feedback for this Google SERP API or simply found a bug, please create an issue on the Actor’s [Issues tab](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper/issues/open).\n',

Go from beginner to expert, all in one place.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Welcome to <strong>Web scraping basics for JavaScript devs</strong>, a comprehensive, practical and long form web scraping course that will take you from an absolute beginner to a successful web scraper developer. If you\'re looking for a quick start, we recommend trying <a href="https://blog.apify.com/web-scraping-javascript-nodejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a> instead.</p>\n<p>This course is made by <a href="https://apify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apify</a>, the web scraping and automation platform, but we will use only open-source technologies throughout all academy lessons. This means that the skills you learn will be applicable to any scraping project, and you\'ll be able to run your scrapers on any computer. No Apify account needed.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn about the Apify platform and how it can help you build, run and scale your web scraping and automation projects, see the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/apify-platform">Apify platform course</a>, where we\'ll teach you all about Apify serverless infrastructure, proxies, API, scheduling, webhooks and much more.</p>\n<h2 id="why-learn">Why learn scraper development?<a href="#why-learn" aria-label="Direct link to Why learn scraper development?" title="Direct link to Why learn scraper development?">​</a></h2>\n<p>With so many point-and-click tools and no-code software that can help you extract data from websites, what is the point of learning web scraper development? Contrary to what their marketing departments say, a point-and-click or no-code tool will never be as flexible, as powerful, or as optimized as a custom-built scraper.</p>\n<p>Any software can do only what it was programmed to do. If you build your own scraper, it can do anything you want. And you can always quickly change it to do more, less, or the same, but faster or cheaper. The possibilities are endless once you know how scraping really works.</p>\n<p>Scraper development is a fun and challenging way to learn web development, web technologies, and understand the internet. You will reverse-engineer websites and understand how they work internally, what technologies they use and how they communicate with their servers. You will also master your chosen programming language and core programming concepts. When you truly understand web scraping, learning other technologies like React or Next.js will be a piece of cake.</p>\n<h2 id="summary">Course Summary<a href="#summary" aria-label="Direct link to Course Summary" title="Direct link to Course Summary">​</a></h2>\n<p>When we set out to create the Academy, we wanted to build a complete guide to web scraping - a course that a beginner could use to create their first scraper, as well as a resource that professionals will continuously use to learn about advanced and niche web scraping techniques and technologies. All lessons include code examples and code-along exercises that you can use to immediately put your scraping skills into action.</p>\n<p>This is what you\'ll learn in the <strong>Web scraping basics for JavaScript devs</strong> course:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners">Web scraping basics for JavaScript devs</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/data-extraction">Basics of data extraction</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/crawling">Basics of crawling</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/best-practices">Best practices</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements" aria-label="Direct link to Requirements" title="Direct link to Requirements">​</a></h2>\n<p>You don\'t need to be a developer or a software engineer to complete this course, but basic programming knowledge is recommended. Don\'t be afraid, though. We explain everything in great detail in the course and provide external references that can help you level up your web scraping and web development skills. If you\'re new to programming, pay very close attention to the instructions and examples. A seemingly insignificant thing like using <code>[]</code> instead of <code>()</code> can make a lot of difference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don\'t already have basic programming knowledge and would like to be well-prepared for this course, we recommend learning about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/javascript-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript basics</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Selectors</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you progress to the more advanced courses, the coding will get more challenging, but will still be manageable to a person with an intermediate level of programming skills.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should have at least a moderate understanding of the following concepts:</p>\n<h3 id="javascript-and-node">JavaScript + Node.js<a href="#javascript-and-node" aria-label="Direct link to JavaScript + Node.js" title="Direct link to JavaScript + Node.js">​</a></h3>\n<p>It is recommended to understand at least the fundamentals of JavaScript and be proficient with Node.js prior to starting this course. If you are not yet comfortable with asynchronous programming (with promises and <code>async...await</code>), loops (and the different types of loops in JavaScript), modularity, or working with external packages, we would recommend studying the following resources before coming back and continuing this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE&amp;ab_channel=Fireship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>async...await</code> (YouTube)</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript loops (MDN)</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-use-modular-patterns-in-nodejs-982f0e5c8f6e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modularity in Node.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="general-web-development">General web development<a href="#general-web-development" aria-label="Direct link to General web development" title="Direct link to General web development">​</a></h3>\n<p>Throughout the next lessons, we will sometimes use certain technologies and terms related to the web without explaining them. This is because their knowledge will be <strong>assumed</strong> (unless we\'re showing something out of the ordinary).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/data-extraction/browser-devtools">DevTools</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="jquery-or-cheerio">jQuery or Cheerio<a href="#jquery-or-cheerio" aria-label="Direct link to jQuery or Cheerio" title="Direct link to jQuery or Cheerio">​</a></h3>\n<p>We\'ll be using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cheerio</strong></a> package a lot to parse data from HTML. This package provides an API using jQuery syntax to help traverse downloaded HTML within Node.js.</p>\n<h2 id="next">Next up<a href="#next" aria-label="Direct link to Next up" title="Direct link to Next up">​</a></h2>\n<p>The course begins with a small bit of theory and moves into some realistic and practical examples of extracting data from the most popular websites on the internet using your browser console. <a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/introduction">Let\'s get to it!</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you already have experience with HTML, CSS, and browser DevTools, feel free to skip to the <a href="https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners/crawling">Basics of crawling</a> section.</p>\n</blockquote></div></div></div>',
